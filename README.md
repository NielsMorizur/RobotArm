# RobotArm

This arm consisted of 4 buttons, 2 for up or down movement, 1 for opening and closing the gripper, and 1 for stopping the gripper in case the FSR does not detect the item being grabbed. Horizontal movement was done manually since the arm was on a spinning base. This code controls a small DC motor for vertical movement and a stepper motor for the gripper.
